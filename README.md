# Face-Recognition
FaceNet Notebook using inception network for encoding. 

# FaceNet
FaceNet learns a neural network that encodes a face image into a vector of 128 numbers. 
By comparing two such vectors, you can then determine if two pictures are of the same person.

**Encoding model** : Inception 

**Loss**: Triplet loss
