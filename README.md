# Face-Recognition
This repository is composed to 3 main sub-projects: FaceNet Notebook, Liveliness Net &amp; Real Time Face Recognition.

# FaceNet
FaceNet learns a neural network that encodes a face image into a vector of 128 numbers. 
By comparing two such vectors, you can then determine if two pictures are of the same person.

**Encoding model** : Inception 

**Loss**: Triplet loss
